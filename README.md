## 介绍

基于self-instruct,evol—instruct，辅以联网学习生成的数据，指令由简单到复杂，input里的分析为联网学习的分析结果

## 存在问题：
1.指令不一定完全正确，但可以不断迭代

## Introduction

Based on self-instruct and evol-instruct, supplemented by data generated through online learning, the instructions range from simple to complex. The analysis in the input is the result of online learning analysis.

## Challenges:
1. Instructions may not be entirely accurate, but can be iterated upon continuously.
